## Features

The project has three files:

1. [`driver.sh`](./driver.sh): Responsible for running the other two files.
2. [`odd.sh`](./Odd/odd.sh): A program demonstrating a simple computer worm software.
3. [`even.sh`](./Even/even.sh): A program providing some functionalities.

## Usage

- Change into the cloned directory.
- On a Linux/Unix system, simply run `driver.sh` file using: `./driver.sh`. 
- On Windows, the following command must be used in the CMD `powershell ./driver.sh`.
- In both cases, the driver file must be given execution privilages.
